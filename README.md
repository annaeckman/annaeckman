### Hi there 👋



- 🔭 I’m currently working on completing the TripleTen software engineering bootcamp. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript classes and just refactored a project from a function approach to a class approach
- 🤔 I’m looking for help connecting with other teachers-turned-software-engineers as well as other women and gender non-conforming people in the tech industry! 
- 💬 Ask me about the tiny house I built. 
- 😄 Pronouns: they, them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a twin!
